=====================

Some modules needed be installed in order to the script is executed:

* matplotlib
* h5py
* pandas
* seaborn
* numpy
* PyPDF2
* csv
* python-docx
* biopython

This script is written in python3 and not in python2.

A sh file is present so as to install these modules but in ubuntu or linux configuration but not mac and let alone windows.
The problem for mac is that we need to download macport in order to install pip3. The latter allow to install python modules in python3 and not in python2.
When the pip3 is installed, all you need to do is launched the sh file.
